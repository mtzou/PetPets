# Inspiration
At HackFSU I wanted to learn the technologies that goes into building an Android app game. I also wanted to learn how to start developing front-end. This game merges my love of graphic design and code into one little project.
This was also my first time developing a phone application and my first time becoming familiar with the Android interface. 

# Description 
Front-end designed on Android Studio and photoshop.
Back-end coded in Java.
